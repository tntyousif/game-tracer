# Game Tracer

## Application Idea  
 GameTracker is a web application that enables users to register and manage their video games. Users can update the status of their games (e.g., Completed, Playing, Paused, Planing to play) using a dropdown menu and add notes for each game. The application tracks relationships between users and their games, providing a comprehensive view of their gaming experiences.

## Game Logic (pseudo code) 
1. Adding a New Game: 
- When a user wants to add a new game, they provide the game name, status (selected from a dropdown), and notes. 
- The system creates a new game entry in the database, associating it with the user's ID. 
- The system confirms that the game has been successfully added.

2. Viewing All Games: 
- When a user wants to see all games stored in the database, the system retrieves all game entries. 
- The system displays the complete list, including each gameâ€™s name, status, and notes, allowing users to review their whole collection.

3. Updating Game Information: 
- When a user wants to update a game, they select the game and provide new status and notes. 
- The system searches for the game in the database using its ID. 
- If the game exists, the system updates the status (selected from a dropdown) and notes. 
- The system confirms that the update was successful. 
- If the game does not exist, the system returns an error message. 
- The users can like games on the viewing page.
